This project involves upgrading the digital processing chains of the Radiotelescope Décimétrique de Nançay, and it has selected the RFSoC 4x2 Kit for this purpose due to its high-performance 5GS/s/14-bit ADCs, FPGA computing capabilities, and 100GbE network interface.

The purpose of this internship include becoming proficient in the development tools, assessing the performance of the ADCs using laboratory signals, and evaluating the 100GbE network link.

RFSoC 4x2 is the optimal replacement solution for older generation circuit boards. As one of the new tools with many features, RFSoC 4x2 is expected to be designed to match the features of telescope and upgrade capabilities that the old circuit system cannot do.
